# TAKEOVER — AI Handoff

Status: Pre-implementation
Date: 2026-09-11

## Project

TAKEOVER is a Nimiq Pay Mini App for the last-minute marketplace of released/scarce capacity.

Core loop:

```text
Provider publishes slot
      ↓
Buyer discovers slot
      ↓
Buyer claims/holds slot
      ↓
Buyer pays exact NIM amount via Nimiq Pay
      ↓
Backend verifies transaction on-chain
      ↓
Claim becomes PAID
      ↓
Provider sees paid claim / buyer sees confirmation
```

## Current status

Product design, business logic, architecture, security model, data model, API requirements, UX structure, and phased implementation plan have been completed before implementation.

No application implementation should be assumed complete merely because a starter scaffold exists.

## Important product decisions

- MVP is provider-created capacity, not arbitrary consumer reservation transfer.
- NIM-only payments for MVP.
- Direct provider payout, no escrow.
- Backend is authoritative for payment verification.
- No AI in MVP.
- No calendar integrations.
- No ratings/reputation.
- No fiat payments.
- Published commercial fields are immutable.
- Inventory claims are protected with DB transactions and uniqueness constraints.

## Fixed stack

React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + Nimiq Mini App SDK

Fastify + TypeScript + Zod

PostgreSQL + Drizzle, hosted on Supabase

Vercel frontend, Railway API

## Critical architecture invariants

1. Browser cannot declare a payment successful.
2. Browser cannot choose the payout recipient for an already-issued payment intent.
3. Browser cannot change slot ownership.
4. Browser cannot set admin role.
5. Claiming the same final unit is concurrency-safe.
6. Replaying an auth challenge fails.
7. Replaying a verified transaction against a second claim fails.
8. All protected resources are authorized server-side.
9. Secrets remain server-only.
10. Payment verification is deterministic and independent of LLMs.

## Current phase

**Phase 0 complete — Repository reconnaissance done (2026-09-11). Next: Phase 1 — Foundation and environment (NOT started, awaiting explicit instruction).**

## Phase 0 reconnaissance results (2026-09-11)

Baseline: the repository contains NO application code. Tracked in git: only
`README.md` (2 lines). Present in working tree but untracked before this
checkpoint: `AGENTS.md`, `AI_HANDOFF.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `PROJECT_SPEC.md`, `TAKEOVER_COMPLETE_BLUEPRINT.md`.

- Architecture (actual): none implemented. No frontend, backend, database,
  auth, payment, tests, lint/build scripts, env config, or deployment config.
- Stack (actual): no `package.json`, no lockfile, no dependencies at all —
  specified stack (React+Vite+Tailwind+SDK / Fastify+Zod / Postgres+Drizzle)
  is 0% implemented. Greenfield.
- Entry points: none. No `src/`, `apps/`, `index.html`, server entry.
- Reusable components: none exist.
- Nimiq integration: none. No `@nimiq/mini-app-sdk`, no wallet/auth/payment code.
- Backend/database: none. No Fastify app, no Drizzle schema, no migrations.
- Auth/payment: none. No sessions, challenges, claims, intents, verification.
- Spec comparison: every MUST HAVE in `PROJECT_SPEC.md` (FR-01–FR-11) and every
  system in `ARCHITECTURE.md` is unimplemented. No conflicts with the spec —
  there is no code to conflict. Spec docs are mutually consistent.
- Security risks in existing code: none (no code). Process risks noted:
  spec docs were untracked in git; no `LICENSE` (competition requires MIT —
  Phase 15 item); no secrets present (good); remote is public GitHub
  `onyebuchidaniel60/TAKEOVER`.
- Verification run: `npm run build` / `lint` / `test` all fail with ENOENT
  (no `package.json`) — N/A by design at baseline. Typecheck N/A (no
  `tsconfig`). Toolchain: node `v24.20.0`, npm `11.19.0` (via `npm.cmd`;
  `npm.ps1` blocked by ExecutionPolicy). `git log`: single commit `82764dc`
  "Initial commit" (README only).
- Phase 1 will CREATE (no existing files to modify): `package.json` +
  lockfile, `apps/web` (React+Vite+TS+Tailwind+SDK scaffold), `apps/api`
  (Fastify+TS+Zod), env validation module, DB client/config, `GET /health`,
  dev scripts, `.gitignore`, `tsconfig` base.
- Blockers: none hard. Phase 1 needs: package-manager choice, monorepo layout
  confirmation (`apps/web`, `apps/api` per plan), Supabase project/connection
  string for DB smoke test, Node version pin.

## Checkpoint

```text
CURRENT PHASE: Phase 0 complete
COMPLETED: repository audit
TESTS RUN: npm run build / lint / test — all N/A (ENOENT, no package.json);
  typecheck N/A (no tsconfig); git/file-system inspection done
RESULT: baseline confirmed — greenfield repo, spec docs consistent, no code
KNOWN ISSUES: spec docs were untracked; no LICENSE yet (Phase 15);
  npm.ps1 blocked by Windows ExecutionPolicy (use npm.cmd)
SECURITY NOTES: no application code, no secrets, nothing to exploit;
  no auth/payment surface exists yet
FILES CHANGED: AI_HANDOFF.md (this checkpoint); newly tracked baseline docs:
  AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, PROJECT_SPEC.md,
  TAKEOVER_COMPLETE_BLUEPRINT.md
GIT COMMIT: chore: baseline repository audit
NEXT TASK: Phase 1 — Foundation and environment (do NOT start automatically)
BLOCKED BY: none (needs: package-manager + layout confirmation, Supabase DB URL)
```

## Exact next task (Phase 1 — awaiting explicit instruction, DO NOT start)

Phase 1 objective per `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: make the fixed
frontend/backend/database architecture boot cleanly (workspaces, env
validation, Zod, Drizzle connection, `GET /health`, dev scripts, preserve Nimiq
SDK integration). STOP — do not begin Phase 1 automatically.

## Known deliberate limitations

The MVP has no escrow or automated refunds. This is a conscious scope/security decision, not an unfinished feature.

The MVP does not automatically prove that an external business booking exists. The marketplace assumes the publisher is authorized to provide the listed capacity and provides reporting/moderation controls for abuse.

## Implementation detail allowance

The agent may choose low-level implementation details only when they do not change externally visible product behavior or architecture. Such decisions must be documented when material.
